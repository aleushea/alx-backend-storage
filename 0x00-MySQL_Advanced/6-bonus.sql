-- Write a SQL script that creates a stored procedure
-- AddBonus that adds a new correction for a student.
-- Procedure AddBonus is taking 3 inputs (in this order):
-- user_id, a users.id value (you can assume user_id is
-- linked to an existing users)
-- project_name, a new or already exists projects - if
-- no projects.name found in the -- table, you should create it
-- score, the score value for the correction
-- Context: Write code in SQL is a nice level up!
